<p>Having a job while being a college student is a path most students go down at the University of Maryland, College Park. </p>
	
<p>In a recently conducted poll of 30 students, about 90% of pollers said that they have a job while pursuing school full-time. For junior Jenna Dawson, having a job while being a student allows her to financially support herself and fund her education. </p>

<p>Dawson works with the International Rescue Committee to help settle new refugee families in the area. </p>

<p>“I help families adapt to their placements here in the states [in areas like] English comprehension, financial literacy, etcetera,” she said. In addition, she also is an intern for the government and teleworks from her Leonardtown apartment. </p>

<p>Like Dawson, around 30% of respondents hold two jobs in addition to school. About half of the respondents have one job during the school year. </p>

<p> Senior <a href= "https://twitter.com/shane_connuck" target="_blank"> Shane Connuck </a> holds three jobs during the school year: a lacrosse beat writer for the Washington Post, a play-by-play commentator for Big Ten Plus, and a writer and public relations contact for Maryland Athletics. He enjoys these jobs because of the real-world experience he is getting outside of the classroom, while still being a college student. </p>

<p> Some students work where they live- juniors Faith Antonetti and Natalie Davis work for Resident Life, Antonetti as a Resident Assistant and Davis as a multicultural advocate. </p>
<p>For Antonetti, the decision to be an RA was a no-brainer. She gets to create a welcoming environment for new residents and gets paid to do so. </p>

<p>“I’m an RA so it pays for room and board as well as dining for me. It is important to me because it makes college much more affordable and I also enjoy building the community,” she said. </p>

<p>Davis works to, “have professional working experience as well as to make some income to supplement college fees.” </p>

<p>Not everyone is in it for the money. Sophomore business student Samantha Ferguson works as a marketing intern for Maryland Athletics and isn’t paid for her work. She is currently the secondary marketing contact for the softball team and helps to plan fan entertainment. </p>

<p>“It allows me to gain experience in my field of interest. I also enjoy it,” she said. “My favorite part is being able to make people happy through the experience.”
